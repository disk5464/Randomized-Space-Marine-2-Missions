# Randomized Space Marine 2 Ops Missions
Space Marine 2 Ops mode is a ton of fun, but after a while playing the same class with the same weapons gets a bit boring. This will help with that! 

Just run the EXE and a window will pop up with your new orders!

Want to re-roll your orders? I won't tell the emperor, just click the button and you'll get a whole new set of orders! You'll even get some fresh encouragement from the codex!





## How does it work?
The EXE was created with pyinstaller and all it does is call the python script. The script is basically a bunch of Tinker with some loops and .random. Additionally there is some logic that ensures that the class you choose does not give you a weapon that you cant use, so no primaries for the assault class. Also I did add in the new secondary.

## Are there any requirements?
Just have python installed, that's it!
