# Randomized Space Marine 2 Ops Missions
Space Marine 2 Ops mode is a ton of fun, but after a while playing the same class with the same weapons gets a bit boring. This will help with that! 

Just run the EXE and a window will pop up with your new orders!

Want to re-roll your orders? I won't tell the emperor, just click the button and you'll get a whole new set of orders! You'll even get some fresh encouragement from the codex!
